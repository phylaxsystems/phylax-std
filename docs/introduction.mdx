## Setting up

As part of "docs-driven development", we're going to document code
as we commit it and enforce that in the PR approvals flow.

It's easy to add to the docs! Either add markdown/MDX syntax to an
existing file in /docs, or add a new one (feel free to copy from an
existing one of the same style). 

To add a new file:
 - Create ./docs/mynewfile.mdx or ./docs/sdk-reference/myfeature.mdx etc
 - If you want it to show in the sidebar menu, add it to Navigation in ./mint.js

## Testing

We don't have a staging site set up for docs yet, so it'll be a bit manual
 - Commit and push the new docs to this repo
 - Go to the [github action](https://github.com/phylaxsystems/phylax-docs/actions/workflows/mintlify-compile-docs.yml) for the docs repo
 - At the top of the table showing past workflow runs, on the right side, hit the "Run Workflow" button and run on the main branch
 - cd to the docs repo, checkout the latest from the `docs-prod` branch, and run `mintlify dev` to see the resulting website

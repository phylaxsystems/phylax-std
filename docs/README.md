# phylax-std docs

The reference documentation for phylax-std lives in this folder.
The content of this folder will be pulled into the [phylax-docs](https://github.com/phylaxsystems/phylax-docs) repo where it will be built and published.

The README.md in the root folder should always be kept up to date, so that people are able to use phylax-std independently of the rest of the Phylax stack.

## How to contribute to the phylax-std reference docs

* Only add/update reference documentation to the `docs` folder in [this repository](https://github.com/phylaxsystems/phylax-std/tree/main/docs), not in the `phylax-docs` repo.
* If you add a new file, please add it to the table of contents in the [phylax-docs](https://github.com/phylaxsystems/phylax-docs) repo.
* Use MDX syntax for the reference docs.
* Follow the structure of the existing files.
